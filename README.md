# Warden Warning level display

Shows players warden warning level as a sidebar scoreboard.

Show the display with `/trigger wardenwarn_enable`. Hide it again with `/trigger wardenwarn_disable`. 

These options are available to all players at all times, so this datapack is not suitable for games
where the sidebar's configuration is important to gameplay.
